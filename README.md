The k-mer composition of a genetic string is defined as the allocation of each possible k-mer in which k-mers occur in the string. The first thing being done is that all possible k-mers are ordered lexicographically for a given positive integer k. 
This program can return the k-mer composition when a DNA string is given. 'k' is chosen as 4 in our case and the output is for the given DNA string.
